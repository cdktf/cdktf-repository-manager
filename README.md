# repository-manager

## About
This project handles repository management for the prebuilt Terraform provider packages that are published for use with [Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk). 

CDKTF allows you to use familiar programming languages to define cloud infrastructure and provision it through HashiCorp Terraform. This gives you access to the entire Terraform ecosystem without learning HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform providers can be generatted locally to be used with your application, or installed via one of the prebuilt packages.  We currently publish and maintain a small subset of prebuilt packages for the Terraform providers that currently have the highest usage in CDKTF apps. The current list of prebuilt provider packages can be found [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/cdktf-repository-manager/blob/main/provider.json).

## Information for HashiCorp Partners
We are currently prioritizing publishing a small subset of prebuilt provider packages, based on usage in existing CDKTF applications. If you are a current partner and you are interested in having a prebuilt package made available for your provider, please contact us at [technologypartners@hashicorp.com](mailto:technologypartners@hashicorp.com) and we will add it to the teamâ€™s list for prioritization.
